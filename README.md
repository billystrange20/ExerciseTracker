# ExerciseTracker

This app, made using Xamarin Forms, will simply take a users exercise, along with average and max weight they can do, and store this information for the user to view at their pleasure. The user is able to add, update and delete all exercises.

There is also a weight tracker availiable on the app, displaying a graph showing weight progress over time. The user is able to add and delete all weight inputs.
